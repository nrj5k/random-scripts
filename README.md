random-scripts
==============

These are just random scripts that I use from time to time

- **lazy_updater.sh** is a shell script used to update the nVidia Optimus+Bumblebee drivers for Slackware. You need to get the files from https://github.com/WhiteWolf1776/Bumblebee-SlackBuilds and download them. This makes updating the files easier in general and also when you have just updated your kernel.
- **kernel_update_post.sh** is a script that creates the initrd.gz file and moves the kernel and the initrd file to the right place, that I use
- **darshrun.sh** and **darshrun_mpi.sh** are wrappers for the Darshan HPC I/O characterization tool/Profiler
